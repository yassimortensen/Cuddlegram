# Welcome to Cuddlegram!

Cuddlegram is a WebApp that makes it easy to find new, cute animal instagram accounts to cuddle with. The app allows users to:
  - create and login to an account with a username and password.
  - Be greeted with a homepage showing images from pet instagram accounts that change with each refresh.
  - Use a navigation bar to navigate throughout the site.
  - Click "Find New Pets" to find a new pet cuddlegram account to follow! A random image from a pet instagram account is displayed for the user, and the user can choose to "cuddle" right, or "shoo!" left.
  - All cuddles are saved to the user's history, and every image that pops up also has a comment field to write comments on a specific photo
  - Each photo had a link below to the pet's cuddlegram profile, with more photos to see and an option to cuddle from there! There is also a link to see the pet's official instagram page.
  - All photos have an option for the user to write comments.
  - Any gallery of images that a user sees shuffles and changes with each refresh, so there is never a lack of cute pets to cuddle throughout the site!
