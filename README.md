# Welcome to Cuddlegram!

Cuddlegram is a WebApp that makes it easy to find new, cute animal instagram accounts to cuddle with. The app allows users to:
  - create and login to an account with a username and password.
  - Be greeted with a homepage to view previously liked accounts, images, and comments, and an option to find more pets
  - The interface to find new pets consists of a random image form a pet instagram account displayed for the user, and the user can choose to "cuddle" right, or "shoo!" left
  - All cuddles are saved to the user's history, and every image that pops up also has a comment field to write comments on a specific photo
  - Each photo links to the pet;s official instagram feed, with more photos to see!
